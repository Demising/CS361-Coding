This app is designed to help keep track of games you own.
You can add games into your library manually by going to
the "Add a Game" page and typing the necessary information.

In the "Library" page, you can see the list of games you
added, as well as remove any games you want (though this
action removes data).

As well in the Library page, you can sort the games. You can
do so by typing "Sort Games" and choosing either to sort by
game name, release date, developer, or publisher.
